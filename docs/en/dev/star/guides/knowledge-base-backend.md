# Integrate an External Knowledge Base

The knowledge base backend API lets a plugin connect a remote service, an existing database, or another retrieval system to AstrBot. The Agent can then consume external knowledge through the same retrieval path used for built-in knowledge bases.

The API standardizes discovery and read-only retrieval only. It does not manage knowledge base creation, document uploads, chunks, credentials, or backups. Those management capabilities remain the responsibility of the plugin or external system.

## Implement a backend

A plugin must extend `BaseKnowledgeBaseBackend` and implement these members:

| Member | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `backend_id` | Globally unique backend identifier. It must contain 1–128 characters and may only use ASCII letters, numbers, `-`, `_`, `.`, and `:` |
| `display_name` | Human-readable name used in logs and errors |
| `list_knowledge_bases()` | Return knowledge bases enabled and accessible for the current session |
| `retrieve()` | Retrieve standardized results from selected knowledge bases |

The following example shows a complete plugin structure. Its remote paths and response fields are illustrative; adapt them to your service.

```

The plugin owns the backend and all network connections, threads, and other resources it uses. AstrBot calls `terminate()` when the plugin is disabled or reloaded. The plugin must unregister its backend before closing those resources. Unregistration waits for the backend's in-flight listing and retrieval operations to finish before returning, so it is safe to release resources immediately after unregistering. Repeatedly unregistering the same `backend_id` is safe.

## Query semantics

`KnowledgeBaseQuery` provides these fields:

| Field | Semantics |
| --- | --- |
| `query` | User query text |
| `top_k` | Maximum number of results retained for the complete retrieval request |
| `score_threshold` | Optional backend-local relevance threshold |
| `filters` | Optional backend-specific metadata filters |
| `umo` | Unified message origin for session, tenant, or permission filtering |

`score_threshold` and `filters` are optional hints. A backend may ignore unsupported hints, but its own documentation should make that limitation clear. AstrBot's default Agent retrieval currently supplies only `query`, `top_k`, and `umo`.

Every `KnowledgeBaseHit` must include a `ref` belonging to the current backend and one of the knowledge bases selected for that request. AstrBot discards a hit with a mismatched reference. `rank` starts at 1, and a lower value means a better backend-local rank.

Scores from different backends are not necessarily comparable, so AstrBot does not sort cross-backend results directly by `score`. It merges results by each backend's `rank` and then applies the global `top_k`. Use `metadata` only for backend-specific information; put identity, source, and ranking data in their standard fields.

## Discovery and access control

When external backends are registered, the Agent calls each backend's `list_knowledge_bases(umo=...)` before retrieval and queries every knowledge base it returns. This method represents the set exposed to AstrBot automatic retrieval, not every dataset discoverable in the remote service. Therefore:

- `list_knowledge_bases()` must return only knowledge bases that the current `umo` may access and that are currently enabled.
- Expose discoverable but disabled knowledge bases through plugin configuration or Plugin Pages instead of returning them from this method.
- Return an empty list when a session should not use the backend.
- Do not expose unauthorized knowledge bases and rely only on a second check in `retrieve()`.
- Listing and retrieval may run concurrently, so avoid shared mutable request state in backend implementations.

## Error handling

A backend may raise `KnowledgeBaseBackendError` when a request fails. Multi-backend retrieval also isolates other exceptions, records them as warnings, and continues with other available results.

When partial results are available, return them and describe non-fatal issues in `KnowledgeBaseResponse.warnings`. AstrBot ignores responses with invalid types and hits with empty content, invalid ranks, or mismatched knowledge base references.

## Current scope

The API intentionally remains small and covers only:

- Backend registration and unregistration
- Discovery of knowledge bases available to the current session
- Standardized read-only retrieval requests and results
- Concurrent backend calls, failure isolation, and result merging
- Injection of external retrieval results into the Agent context

Knowledge base creation, document upload and deletion, chunk management, indexing, statistics, backups, credential configuration, and WebUI management are outside this API. A plugin can expose commands, configuration, or Plugin Pages for those capabilities.
